// Why npm is necessary , -> to remove all console.log() at the time of production , for  bundling,optimization of our react code, menify it, chunking, TreeShaking, etc,. ,
// TreeShaking is use to remove un-wanted code .
// Packagelock.json lock the version of the package



// WE did not push node_modules in our git hub repo because it is the heaviest element , so 
// instead of not_modules we push package_lock.json, it has sufficient information about node_modules
// when it is deployed due to the help of package_lock.json , node_modules is reconstructed at the 
// server end .

// npx means execute usign npm. (parcel gives server to us.)

//parcel willl keep the track of all the thing which is changing (HMR-->HOT Module Replacement).
//parcel also take care of port number.
// Parcel uses File Watcher Algorithm written in c++ , which identifies the change happened in our code so it directly update  changes in our live server.
// Pacel create a server for us. 
//Parcel is a bundler that bundle our whole project , it also MINIFY , it also clean our code example it removes all the console.log() for optimizations at server end .
// Parcel does image optimization also.
// Pacel does caching while development. 
// Parcel do compression of our code also.
// parcel make our app compatible with older versions of browsers also.
//Parcel uses consistent hashing algorithm for hashing ,bundling.
//we have our package manager that takes care of Transitive Dependencies or our code. (Transitive Dependencies are means 1 dependency is dependent on another dependency and another dependency is dependent on another dependency and so on).
// React application is so fast because of node_modules, virtual dom , and Transitives dependencies.


// anything which can be auto generated are written inside .gitignore.


//browserslist make our code competable for a lot of browsers even all the old versions of browsers.



//codes to start our program

// npm install
// npm init  (command to initialise npm)

// npm i -D parcel 


// npx parcel index.html          (index.html is entry point).



polyfill is use to convert the new version of code into older version so that our code can 
work on older version. 
if our code does no work on the new version then polyfill will convert the code into older version.

babel actually convert our code to older version code. 
Babel keep track of browserslist and it identifies our browsers 

Babel plugin transform remove plugin is use to remove all the console.log( ) at the time or production of our app.


React.createElement  => Object ==> HTML  => HTML is then put in the dom.


JSX --> React.createElement  => Object ==> HTML  => HTML is then put in the dom. 

Babel convert JSX into React.createElement.

Advantages of JSX
1) Readibility .
2) Less code
3) Better developer experience.
4) Easy Maintainability of code.






Functional Componennt is a functional component the return some react element .
